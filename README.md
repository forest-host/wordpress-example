# Deployable WordPress example
This is an automatically deployable WordPress setup accompanying [this article
about automated WordPress
deployments](https://content.forest.host/guides/automated-wordpress-deployments).

## Bedrock vs. vanilla WordPress
We recommend using [Roots.io Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) instead of the usual way of setting up
WordPress. Bedrock is a modern WordPress boilerplate that makes automated
deployments and working locally way more easy, among other things.
We have an example repository for this as well: [Bedrock WordPress Example](https://github.com/forest-host/bedrock-wordpress-example)
